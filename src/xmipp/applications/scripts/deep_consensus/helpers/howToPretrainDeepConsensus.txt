First add the protocol "protocol_prepare_deepConsensus.py" to xmipp protocols 
by copying it to scipion-em-xmipp/xmipp3/protocols and adding to
~/app/xmipp_bundle/src/scipion-em-xmipp/xmipp3/protocols/__init__.py  the following line

#from .protocol_prepare_deepConsensus import XmippProtPrepareDeepConsensus

Then, train it using different sets of true coordinates and false coordinates.

The order of the sets in the form DO MATTER
