These are bindings for xmipp functions to be used in Matlab without the need of writing and reading doc/sel/spi files.
In order to use these Bindings, you must have a version of Matlab (http://www.matlab.com) installed. The
scons script searches at the default location /usr/local/matlab, you can set any other location by using the
scons environment variable MATLAB_DIR.
