## Release 3.20.07 -

- Fast CTF estimation
- CTF includes phase shifts now
- Selection of alpha helices or beta sheets from a PDB (xmipp_pdb_select)
- Centering a PDB (xmipp_pdb_center)
- New Protocol: MicrographCleaner is a new algorithm that removes coordinates picked from carbon edges, aggregations, ice crystals and other contaminations
- New functionality: The protocol compare reprojections can now compute the residuals after alignment
- New protocol: Split frames divide input movies into odd and even movies so that they can be processed independently
- New protocol: Continuous heterogeneity analysis using spherical harmonics (not ready to be used)
- Bug fixing when some micrograph has no coordinates in the consensus-picking.
- New functionalities: Different architectures and training modes
- Normal Mode Analysis protocols have been moved to the plugin ContinuousFlex
- Fixing MPI version of the Fourier Reconstruction
- New protocol: local CTF integration and consensus protocol for local ctf (also the viewers)
- Local CTF analysis tools: Not yet ready for general public
- New functionallity: Introducing the posibility of automatic estimation of the gain orientation.
- Bugs fixings regarding stability on streaming processing
- Support of heterogeneous movie sets
- New protocol: Clustering of subtomogram coordinates into connected components that can be processed independently
- New Protocol: Removing duplicated coordinates
- New protocol: Subtomograms can be projected in several ways to 2D images so that 2D clustering tools can be used
- New protocol: Regions of Interest can be defined in tomograms (e.g., membranes)
- Bug fixing in mask3d protocol
- Bug fix: in helical search symmetry protocol
- Enhanced precision of the FlexAlign program
- Now, deepLearningToolkit is under its own conda environment
- Multiple protocols accelerated using GPU
- New functionality: Xmipp CTF estimation can now take a previous defocus and do not change it
- New functionallity: CTF-consensus is able to take the primary main values or an average of the two.
- New functionallity: CTF-consensus is able to append metadata from the secondary input
- New functionality: Xmipp Highres can now work with non-phase flipped images
- New functionality: Xmipp Preprocess particles can now phase flip the images
- New protocol: Tool to evaluate the quality of a map-model fitting
- Allowing multi-GPU processing using FlexAlign
- Improvement in monores and localdeblur
- Randomize phases also available for images
- Change the plugin to the new Scipion structure
- Migrating the code to python3
